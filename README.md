# Baldur's Boutique 

Baldur's Boutique is a character creation app built around the game Baldur's Gate 3. It allows the user to select from every Class, Race, Subrace, Skill, Spell, Background, and Item in the game to build out the perfect character for every occasion.

## Installation



```bash
npm run install
npm run develop
```

## Usage

The goal of the app is to help Users design their character before they ever start playing, or help them path their character accordingly. Oftentimes it's hard in game to map out your character one step at a time, Baldur's Boutique allows Users to map their character beforehand, so when the time comes to make decisions on skills, spells, and items to take, the User can just reference the saved build.
